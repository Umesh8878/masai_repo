I was always interested in tech field. But I hadn't any option of how to achieve this after my 12th completion. In 2022 Feb I got to know about Masai School. I went to know that it is offering FSD course with 0 upfront fee. Again then created a hope inside me. I again started thinking of become a software developer. Because me as a belong to a lower middle class family. If I wanted to pursue my education with any private engineering collage , it would be difficyult for my family to bear my expences. So, I can say that Masai is helping a thousends of family to come out of poverty stage and  to start a new journey.
 Thank you Masai!
